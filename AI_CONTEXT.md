# AI Conversation Context

## Summary

The user and I began by establishing and refining a rule for a `save as` command. This rule dictates that I should summarize our conversation, save it to an `AI_CONTEXT.md` file (creating or overwriting it), and then use Git to add, commit, and push the file to the remote repository.

After clarifying the rule, the user attempted to navigate to a local Windows project directory. I explained that I operate in a Linux environment and cannot access local Windows paths directly. I recommended using Git to bring the project files into my environment.

The user then provided a GitHub repository URL, which I successfully cloned into the `/home/daniel/HowToBuildAnAgent` directory.

Finally, the user provided a large block of text, which I used to create a `README.md` file within the newly cloned project directory. The user then triggered the `save as` command.

## Project State

- **Repository:** `https://github.com/daniel-he-emory/HowToBuildAnAgent.git` has been cloned into `/home/daniel/HowToBuildAnAgent`.
- **Files Created:**
    - `/home/daniel/HowToBuildAnAgent/README.md`: Contains a detailed guide on building a code-editing agent.
- **Next Action:** Proceeding with the `save as` workflow to commit and push the `AI_CONTEXT.md` file.
