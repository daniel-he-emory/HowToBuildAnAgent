# AI Conversation Context

## Summary

This session focused on setting up and debugging the Go-based code-editing agent within the `HowToBuildAnAgent` directory, and establishing a file mirroring strategy for the Windows environment.

The conversation began with the user requesting to navigate to the `HowToBuildAnAgent` directory and create aliases (`gemini-agent`, `claude-agent`) for quick navigation. I successfully created these aliases in `~/.bashrc`.

Next, the user requested to build the agent step-by-step according to the `README.md`. This involved:
- Initializing the Go module (`go mod init agent`).
- Creating `main.go`.
- Adding the initial Go skeleton code, including `main`, `NewAgent`, `Agent` struct, `Run()` method, and `runInference` method.
- Setting the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable, both temporarily and permanently in `~/.bashrc`.
- Encountering and debugging a persistent "expected 'package', found 'EOF'" error when trying to run the Go application. This was resolved by ensuring commands were run from the correct relative directory (`HowToBuildAnAgent`).
- Integrating the `read_file` tool:
    - Adding `ToolDefinition` struct.
    - Defining `ReadFileDefinition`, `ReadFileInput`, `ReadFileInputSchema`, `ReadFile` function, and `GenerateSchema` function.
    - Updating `main.go` to include the `read_file` tool in the `Agent`'s `tools` slice and modifying `runInference` to handle tool calls.
    - Installing the `github.com/invopop/jsonschema` dependency.
    - Modifying the `executeTool` function to correctly handle `anthropic.NewToolResultBlock` arguments and format tool results.
- Creating a `secret-file.txt` for testing the `read_file` tool.
- Successfully running the Go agent, which is now interactive in the terminal.

Finally, the user requested a file mirroring strategy for files created in the Linux environment to their Windows counterpart. I confirmed the setup (WSL) and the user provided the base Windows path: `C:\Users\ddani\Projects\HowToBuildAnAgent`. I explicitly copied `main.go` to this Windows path and updated `AI_CONTEXT.md` to reflect this mirroring preference for future file creations.

## Project State

- **Repository:** `https://github.com/daniel-he-emory/HowToBuildAnAgent.git` has been cloned into `/home/daniel/HowToBuildAnAgent`.
- **Files Created/Modified:**
    - `/home/daniel/HowToBuildAnAgent/README.md`: Contains a detailed guide on building a code-editing agent.
    - `/home/daniel/HowToBuildAnAgent/main.go`: Contains the Go agent code with `read_file` tool integration.
    - `/home/daniel/HowToBuildAnAgent/secret-file.txt`: Created for testing the `read_file` tool.
    - `/home/daniel/HowToBuildAnAgent/AI_CONTEXT.md`: Updated to reflect conversation summary and file mirroring preference.
- **Aliases:** `gemini-agent` and `claude-agent` are set in `~/.bashrc` to navigate to `/home/daniel/HowToBuildAnAgent`.
- **Environment Variable:** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is permanently set in `~/.bashrc`.
- **Go Agent Status:** The Go agent is currently running and interactive in the terminal.

## File Management Preferences

- **File Mirroring:** All files created or modified in the Linux environment within the project directory (`/home/daniel/HowToBuildAnAgent/`) will also be mirrored to the corresponding Windows environment path: `C:\Users\ddani\Projects\HowToBuildAnAgent`.

## Next Action

Proceeding with the `save as` workflow to commit and push the `AI_CONTEXT.md` file.
